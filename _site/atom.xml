   <content type="html">#Welcome to my little slice of the Internet!

My name is Trevor Reed, and I will be your guide through this simple website. Some of you may be asking &quot;Why am I here?&quot; or even &quot;What is the purpose of this website?&quot;. While I cannot answer for you,
why you are here, I can tell you what my intended use for this website is. I plan on using the site for sharing my insights into the ever changing world of Technology. I know there are coutless sites
on the Internet where you can read about the newest technology, and I know I could never compete with those, however I believe that there is always room for one more voice on how to improve our lives
with new technology.
